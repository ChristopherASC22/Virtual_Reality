# Virtual_Reality_CodeAlong
This was a project I did as part of a Code Along. It has come to my attention that this project may cause some low-end devices to crash.
If you have a low-end device, please don't hasitate to use the low-res version of the VR: 
The only difference is that this version has a background while the low-res has no background as the a-sky function will be commented out.
